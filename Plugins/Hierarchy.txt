Plugins Hierarchy Information:

All plugins need to have hierarchy, like:

┌ PluginFolder
├── PluginAssembly.dll
└── <plugin_files>

In 'PluginFolder', you can have any thing you want
images, texts, anything.

So, please dont install all plugins in root folder (Plugins)
To prevent conflicts with files and etc.

eto ya.
